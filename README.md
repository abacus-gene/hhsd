# HHSD
HHSD can be used to perform Hierarchical Heuristic Species Delimitation from multilocus genetic data.
# Installation
HHSD relies on BPP ver 4.6+ for parameter estimation, so this must be installed first. 
Installation then consists of:
- cloning this repository
- navigating to the folder where the code has been cloned
- running the command ``` pip install -e . ```
This will install all python dependencies automatically.
